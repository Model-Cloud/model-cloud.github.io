# ModelCloud Documentation

Welcome to **ModelCloud** â€“ the decentralized AI inference network that makes large language models accessible, affordable, and globally distributed.

## What is ModelCloud?

ModelCloud is a revolutionary platform that transforms how AI inference works by creating a decentralized marketplace where:

- **Developers** get instant access to powerful language models through our OpenAI-compatible API
- **GPU owners** monetize their hardware by running inference nodes and earning per token
- **Everyone** benefits from reduced latency, lower costs, and censorship-resistant AI

## Core Features

### ðŸš€ **OpenAI-Compatible API**
Drop-in replacement for OpenAI's API with zero code changes required. Start using models like Llama, Mistral, and more through familiar endpoints.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.modelcloud.ai/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "llama-3.2-3b", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```

### âš¡ **Intelligent Routing**
Our smart routing engine automatically selects the fastest available node based on:
- Geographic proximity
- Node performance metrics
- Real-time latency measurements
- Model availability

### ðŸ’° **Decentralized Marketplace**
- **For Developers**: Pay only for successful inference, with transparent per-token pricing
- **For Node Operators**: Earn cryptocurrency for every token generated on your hardware
- **Global Network**: Redundancy and reliability through distributed infrastructure

### ðŸ”’ **Privacy & Security**
- No data logging or storage
- End-to-end encryption
- Censorship-resistant architecture
- Your prompts never leave the inference process
